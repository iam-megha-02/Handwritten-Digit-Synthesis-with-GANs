# Handwritten Digit Synthesis with GANs

A simple project that uses a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) in TensorFlow to generate new handwritten digits based on your own image dataset.

**Requires:** `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

---

### 1. Setup

Before running, create this folder structure in your Google Drive:
/content/drive/MyDrive/
├── Handwriting_GAN/
└── augmented_digits/

Place your custom handwritten digit images (as `.png` files) inside the `augmented_digits` folder.

### 2. Run

Open the Python script in Google Colab and run all cells. The script will train the model and save generated images to the `Handwriting_GAN` folder.
